# CS-330


How do I approach designing software?
My approach always begins with breaking down what it is that I want to acoomplish. Understanding the steps that I need to take to create something that reaches that goal
is paramount to being succesful, I feel.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I feel that I have a better understanding of Modularity thanks to this project. Most of the project was developed in sections across the duration of the various assignments.
Learning how to properly bring all of those functions together without sending the project into an unuseable mess was great!

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Modular. As stated above, I developed and designed a lot of the project over the course of various assignments.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think I could still stand to polish my design approach. However, I am hoping that this will assist me with creating more modular programs in the future.

How do I approach developing programs?
It goes back to the design process. This would be the second part, properly implementing functions that accomplish the goal that I've set for the program.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Being able to properly use the glDrawElements function to render the shapes.

How did iteration factor into your development?
I'm not entirely sure.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I had several eureka moments when working on the different milestones that led to me eventual completeing and understanding of how to finish the final project.
Being able to apply the different milestones modularly to the final project was a massive help!

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I'm a CS major, so everythign computer science is working towards my eventual professional goals.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational/professional pathways?
I've chosen to combine the last two questions here into one as I feel the answer is the same.
The greatest thing I was able to pull from this course was a better understanding on how to properly implement modularity within the development process.
Reading and properly understanding the documentation alongsied actual visual representations of the code was incredibly helpful as well.
Being able to see the physical output based on what you code is something that I believe only helps me when develping programs.
As stated above, I'm a CS major so anything I can take away from this course will help me with all future educational/professional goals.
